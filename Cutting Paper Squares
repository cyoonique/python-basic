'''Mary has an  piece of paper that she wants to cut into  pieces according to the following rules: She can only cut one piece of paper
at a time, meaning she cannot fold the paper or layer already-cut pieces on top of one another.
Each cut is a straight line from one side of the paper to the other side of the paper. '''
